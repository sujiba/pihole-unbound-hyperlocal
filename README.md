## Introduction
**Pi-hole**:
- Pi-hole is a DNS sinkhole that protects your devices from unwanted content, without installing any client-side software.

**Unbound**:
- Unbound is a validating, recursive, caching DNS resolver. It is designed to be fast and lean and incorporates modern features based on open standards. 

**Hyperlocal**:
- To spare the initial DNS query to the DNS-Root-Servers by Unbound, we provide Unbound with an appropriate configuration. With each Pi-hole update, the DNS-Root-Zone (root.hints) is also updated. 

## Prerequisites
- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Install [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## First startup
Clone the repository to your favored location and change the config.
```
git clone -b main https://github.com/sujiba/pihole-unbound-hyperlocal.git pihole-unbound-hyperlocal-v6

# Change the timezone, password and other pi-hole settings
cp example.pihole.env pihole.env
vi pihole.env

# Change the ports if you're running a reverse proxy on ports 80 and 443
vi compose.yml
```

Start the container
```
docker compose up -d
```

Check the logs
```
docker compose logs -f
```

### Testing
```
docker compose exec -it pihole-unbound sh
dig github.com @127.0.0.1 +short
dig sigfail.verteiltesysteme.net @127.0.0.1 | grep status 
dig sigok.verteiltesysteme.net @127.0.0.1 | grep status
```
- First dig should show an IP address
- Second dig should show status: SERVFAIL
- Last dig should show status: NOERROR

## DNS problems
If you are running other docker containers on the same host and cannot use name resolution within these containers, you have to modify /etc/resolvconf.conf on your host system and uncomment the following:
```
# If you run a local name server, you should uncomment the below line and
# configure your subscribers configuration files below.
name_servers=127.0.0.1
```
Write the changes to your resolv.conf:
```
sudo resolvconf -u
```
